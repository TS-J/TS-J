# TS-J | Open Community
TS-J, to bulid a free and open developer community, that easy to find and publish.

We are from China. We face the world. if the Internet belongs to everyone, we are here for them.

The main members are MCCF (Bingyuan Zou) and JHRWX (Zhongmiao Ma). We are not a big group yet, but we will try our best to contribute to the development of information technology.

## Why Are We Here
The Internet is a global project and changing the world at the same time. With the development of the Internet, a large number of data can be quickly obtained on the network, and it is easy to use and access, modify and keep pace with the times.

For example, MDN is a large developer network, which contains a lot of content about Web API, nearly a thousand documents and detailed compatibility description. Imagine how useful this is for developers of cross browser compatible plugins!

Most importantly, it is constantly updated. Although it may not always display latest data, it is difficult for existing books and textbooks to do so without the help of the Internet.

However, the greatest use of books is no longer to provide information and reference. For example, learning JavaScript, or learning an algorithm, for beginners, it is not easy to completely rely on the network to master. It's not that there are no substantive resources, on the contrary, there are too many resources about these contents on the Internet, but most of them can't be completely covered by an article.

Few specialized organizations integrate these materials to make them easy to modify, search, browse and understand. I think it's very important to integrate the resources provided by all people through the Internet, so that every user accessing it can learn, understand or use them with these resources.

As you can see, TSJ is one of the organizations trying to solve this problem. "Team" means that each user can participate in and enrich the community, while "Self" means that each user can easily get information and resources from it, instead of having to gradually understand its core ideas from thick books; we hope that the Internet can become a platform for self-study and targeted studying.

## What Does Our Name Mean?
Oh, right, we are called TSJ, but we don't pay attention to its specific meaning any more. You are free to imagine what it means, which may lead to interesting results, such as TeacherJustStayedï¼Ÿ Oh, my God. However, we still think that there are many fun things can happen, such as we may build a tstyle.css stylesheet, or we currently mainly implement the term.js plugin, and our website project TS-Judge, etc.

If you do want to know what the name means when it's determined, think about TeamSelf-J (In fact, this is still not the right answer).
